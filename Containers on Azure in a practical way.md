# Containers on Azure in a practical way

## Requirements
Microsoft Azure subscription

## Exercises
The purpose of the lab is to help you understand what a container is and how containers can be deployed on Azure. We would focus on the Azure Container Service, Azure Container Instance and the App Service. 

The lab has 4 different exercises:  
1. Discover what is a container

## More info
The container ecosystem is evolving fast. Big players like Docker are introducing updates in their products every month making a challenge to keep updated. The following image shows a summary of the different pieces around containers related with the Docker Ecosystem. 

Knowing in detail about all of them is an impossible mission.
